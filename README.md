# ai-chatbot
This project is in HTML, CSS and Javascript where using OpenAI, a fully functioning AI Chatbot is created.

To make the AI chatbot work, download the files to your local computer. Then, open the script.js file and add your own secret API Key. 
The API key can be found by generating it using the OpenAI Platform. You are required to have an OpenAI account to be able to generate a secret API key.
Copy and then paste the key in script.js at the line of code that says "API Key"
Then open index.html using a web browser and look at the AI chatbot work.
